    <h1>Coding Challenge #3</h1>
    <p>
      There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against
      each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a
      trophy!
    </p>

    <h2>Your tasks:</h2>
    <p>
      1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data
      below.<br />
      2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the
      competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a
      draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average
      score).<br />
      3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this
      rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and
      the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator
      to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks. ðŸ˜‰<br />
      4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens
      when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal
      100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.<br />
